# ~~Parc3l~~ Wasm Particle Brush

(Forked from my original project: [Parc3l](https://github.com/AndresCuervo/parc3l))

Note: this also requires a [three.ar.js](https://github.com/google-ar/three.ar.js) capable mobile browser.

This is a little demo project providing the simplest proof of concept for combining the following technologies:

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
- [Web Assembly](http://webassembly.org/)

This is all done using [Parcel JS](https://parceljs.org/).

You can see the project up and running at [https://parc3l.glitch.me/](https://parc3l.glitch.me/)
